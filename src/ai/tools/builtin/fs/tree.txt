- Render a shallow directory tree from a starting path
- Accepts absolute, home, or project-relative paths
- Skips common build/cache folders (node_modules, dist, .git, etc.) by default
- Depth is capped to avoid excessive output (1â€“5)

Usage tips:
- Use the LS tool for a flat listing of one directory
- Use the Glob and Grep tools for file pattern and content searches respectively
