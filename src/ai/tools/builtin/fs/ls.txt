- Lists files and directories in a given path (non-recursive)
- Accepts absolute ('/...'), home ('~/...'), or project-relative paths
- Hides common build and cache folders by default (node_modules, dist, .git, etc.)
- Optional ignore patterns allow further filtering of directory names

Usage tips:
- Prefer the Glob tool for pattern-based discovery and Grep for content search
- Use the Tree tool for a hierarchical view with limited depth
