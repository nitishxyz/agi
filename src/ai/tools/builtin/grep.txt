- Fast content search tool powered by ripgrep (rg)
- Supports full regex syntax (e.g., "log.*Error", "function\\s+\\w+")
- Optional include glob to filter files (e.g., "*.js", "*.{ts,tsx}")
- Returns files with at least one match and line previews, sorted by modification time
- Skips common build and cache folders by default; add 'ignore' patterns to refine

Usage tips:
- For counting matches, use the Bash tool with rg directly (do not use grep)
- Batch multiple searches when exploring a codebase broadly
