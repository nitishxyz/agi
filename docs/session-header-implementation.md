# Session Header Implementation

## Overview
Added a session header at the top of the message thread that displays key session information including title, token usage, time, and estimated cost.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created SessionHeader Component
**File:** `apps/web/src/components/sessions/SessionHeader.tsx`

Features:
- **Large Title Display**: Shows session title (or "Untitled Session" as fallback)
- **Token Statistics**: 
  - Total tokens used
  - Breakdown of input/output tokens
  - Formatted with commas for readability
- **Tool Time**: Displays total time spent on tool operations
- **Estimated Cost**: Calculates approximate cost based on token usage
  - Uses example rates (configurable)
  - Only shows when cost > 0
- **Model Information**: Shows provider, model, and agent
- **Sticky Positioning**: Header stays at the top while scrolling
- **Clean Layout**: Uses icons and a card-based design

### 2. Updated MessageThread Component
**File:** `apps/web/src/components/messages/MessageThread.tsx`

Changes:
- Added `session?: Session` prop to receive session data
- Integrated `SessionHeader` component at the top of the scroll container
- Made header sticky so it scrolls with the thread
- Reorganized layout structure to accommodate the header

### 3. Updated App Component
**File:** `apps/web/src/App.tsx`

Changes:
- Added logic to find and pass the active session object
- Updated `MessageThread` usage to include session prop

## UI/UX Features

### Visual Design
- Sticky header with semi-transparent background and backdrop blur
- Consistent with existing design system (uses Tailwind classes)
- Icons from lucide-react for visual clarity
- Responsive layout that wraps on smaller screens

### Information Display
- **Total Tokens**: Shows aggregate count with input/output breakdown
- **Tool Time**: Human-readable format (e.g., "2h 15m", "45m 30s", "12s")
- **Estimated Cost**: Calculated based on model pricing (placeholder rates)
- **Model Info**: Right-aligned showing provider/model/agent details

### Scroll Behavior
- Header remains visible while scrolling through messages
- Integrates seamlessly with existing auto-scroll functionality
- Maintains the "Scroll to bottom" button when user scrolls up

## Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Pricing**: Update cost calculation to use actual pricing for different models
2. **Real-time Updates**: Session stats update as new messages arrive (already supported via session prop)
3. **Additional Metrics**: Could add more stats like average response time, message count, etc.
4. **Customization**: Allow users to toggle which stats are displayed
5. **Export/Share**: Add buttons to export session data or copy stats

## Technical Notes

- Uses React `useMemo` for performance optimization of calculated values
- Session prop is optional to maintain backward compatibility
- Header only renders when session data is available
- All token/time values handle null/undefined gracefully
