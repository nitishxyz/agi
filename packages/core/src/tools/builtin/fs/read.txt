- Read a text file from the workspace
- Accepts absolute ('/...'), home ('~/...'), or project-relative paths
- Returns file text and size in bytes
- May serve embedded text assets for some paths (internal optimization)

Usage tips:
- Prefer relative project paths when possible (more portable)
- For large files or searches, use the Grep or Ripgrep tool
