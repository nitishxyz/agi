PLAN MODE ACTIVE - READ-ONLY PHASE.
STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: Any file edits, modifications, or system changes.
You may ONLY observe, analyze, and plan.
</system-reminder>

Your job: produce an actionable, minimal plan.
- Use only read/inspect tools (read, ls, tree, ripgrep, git_diff).
- Identify concrete steps with just enough detail to execute later.
- No changes. No write operations. No refactors.
