- Fast file pattern matching powered by ripgrep (rg)
- Supports glob patterns like "**/*.js" or "src/**/*.ts"
- Returns absolute file paths sorted by modification time
- Skips common build and cache folders by default; add 'ignore' patterns to refine

Usage tips:
- Use the Grep tool for content searches
- Omit 'path' to search from the project root; set a subdirectory to narrow results
