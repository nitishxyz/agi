- Find files matching glob patterns (e.g., "*.ts", "**/*.tsx", "src/**/*.{js,ts}")
- Returns a list of matching file paths relative to the search directory
- Supports standard glob syntax: * (any chars), ** (any dirs), {a,b} (alternatives), [abc] (character sets)
- Automatically excludes common build/cache folders (node_modules, dist, .git, etc.)
- Results sorted by modification time (most recent first)

Usage tips:
- Use this tool to find files by name or extension patterns
- Use Grep or Ripgrep tools to search file contents
- Combine with path parameter to search in specific directories only
