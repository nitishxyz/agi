Makes multiple edits to a single file in one operation. Built on top of the Edit tool.

Prefer this tool over Edit when you need to make multiple changes to the same file.

Parameters:
1. filePath: The path to the file to modify (relative or absolute)
2. edits: An array of edit operations, each with:
   - oldString: The text to replace (must match file contents)
   - newString: The replacement text
   - replaceAll: Optional, replace all occurrences (default false)

IMPORTANT:
- Edits are applied in sequence, each operating on the result of the previous
- All edits must succeed or none are applied
- Plan edits carefully to avoid conflicts between sequential operations
