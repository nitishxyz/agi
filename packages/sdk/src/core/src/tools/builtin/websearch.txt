- Search the web or fetch content from URLs
- Use `query` to search the web and get a list of results with titles, URLs, and snippets
- Use `url` to fetch and read the content of a specific webpage
- Returns cleaned, text-based content (HTML tags are stripped)
- Cannot be used for both search and URL fetch in the same call

Usage tips:
- For research: use `query` to find relevant pages, then `url` to read specific ones
- Search returns up to 10 results with titles, URLs, and snippets
- URL fetching works for text-based content (HTML, JSON, XML, plain text)
- Content is automatically truncated if it exceeds maxLength (default 50,000 chars)
- Use this to gather current information, read documentation, or verify facts
