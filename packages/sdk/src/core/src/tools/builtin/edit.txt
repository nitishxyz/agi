Performs exact string replacements in files.

Usage:
- You must use your `Read` tool at least once in the conversation before editing. This tool will error if you attempt an edit without reading the file.
- When editing text from Read tool output, ensure you preserve the exact indentation (tabs/spaces) as it appears in the file.
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files in the codebase. NEVER write new files unless explicitly required.
- The edit will FAIL if `oldString` is not found in the file with an error "oldString not found in content".
- The edit will FAIL if `oldString` is found multiple times in the file with an error about multiple matches. Either provide a larger string with more surrounding context to make it unique or use `replaceAll` to change every instance.
- Use `replaceAll` for replacing and renaming strings across the file. This parameter is useful for renaming a variable.
- To create a new file, use an empty `oldString` and set `newString` to the file contents.
