- Write text to a file in the workspace
- Creates the file if it does not exist (when allowed)
- Only writes within the project root; absolute paths are rejected
- Returns a compact patch artifact summarizing the change

Usage tips:
- Use for creating NEW files
- Use when replacing >70% of a file's content (almost complete rewrite)
- NEVER use for partial/targeted edits - use apply_patch or edit instead
- Using write for partial edits wastes output tokens and risks hallucinating unchanged parts
- Prefer idempotent writes by providing the full intended content when you do use write
