Call this tool AFTER you have completed all your work AND streamed your final summary/response to the user.

This signals the end of your turn and that you are done with the current request.

**CRITICAL**: You MUST always call this tool when you are completely finished. The workflow is:
1. Perform all necessary tool calls (read files, make changes, etc.)
2. Stream your final text response/summary to the user
3. Call the finish tool to signal completion

Do NOT call finish before streaming your response. Do NOT forget to call finish after responding.
